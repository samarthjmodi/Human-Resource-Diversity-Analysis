# DATA 512 A: Final class project

## Goal
By performing an exploratory analysis on Human Resource data, I wish to learn about the industrial paradigm of diversity. Specifically, I wish to have a holistic view of diversity at a typical company and have a better understanding of how far we have come with diversity and inclusion, thus bolstering our human-centered perspective of the same. This analysis will help us learn about different areas where diversity has been properly embraced, and the areas where we need to work more to include more diversity, thus making it a human centered data science project.

## Data Source
For this analysis, I wish to use the dataset made available by Dr. Rich Huebner and Carla Patalano to accompany a case study designed for graduate HR students studying HR metrics, measurement, and analytics. The CSV revolves around an anonymous company and the core data set contains names, DOBs, age, gender, marital status, date of hire, reasons for termination, department, whether they are active or terminated, position title, pay rate, manager name, and performance score.

The dataset can be found here: [Human Resources Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/rhuebner/human-resources-data-set) 

**Citation:** Dr. Carla Patalano, “Human Resources Data Set.” Kaggle, 2020, doi: 10.34740/KAGGLE/DSV/1572001.

The dataset has Creative Commons license, proprietary to New England College of Business, but free for use for academic purpose. Since HR data can be hard to come by, this dataset containing demographic information about the staff of this anonymous company can be deemed fit for our purpose of Diversity Analysis, and thus is very relevant to our problem statement. Since this dataset contains the names of the staff, we have an ethical responsibility to get rid of this personally identifiable information before starting our analysis and we need to make sure that any observed result cannot be mapped to any particular staff member.

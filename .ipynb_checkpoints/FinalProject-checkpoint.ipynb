    "The MSDS program at UW is committed to fostering an inclusive environment for all individuals in our community by promoting diversity and inclusivity. Thus, we see that diversity and inclusion has been given a high priority at academic institutions as UW. This makes me wonder about the industrial paradigm of diversity and inclusion. By performing an exploratory analysis on Human Resource data, I wish to learn about the industrial paradigm of diversity. Specifically, I wish to have a holistic view of diversity at a typical company and have a better understanding of how far we have come with diversity and inclusion. This analysis helps us learn about different areas where diversity has been properly embraced, and the areas where we need to work more to include more diversity, thus making it a human centered data science project."

Since HR data can be hard to come by, this dataset containing demographic information about the staff of this anonymous company can be deemed fit for our purpose of Diversity Analysis. Since this dataset contains the names of the staff, we have an ethical responsibility to get rid of this personally identifiable information before starting our analysis and we need to make sure that any observed result cannot be mapped to any particular staff member.\n"

With diversity and inclusion becoming crucial to the mordern workplace, it is often unclear how far we have reached today in inculcating a culture that is inclusive of personnels demonstrating diversity across race, gender, age, etc. To get a better understanding of the same, we perform an exploratory analysis of Human Resource data from an anonymous workplace. We observe that the workplace does demonstrate diversity and inclusion to a high extend, but it is far from being absolutely non-discriminatory. We learn about the differences in diversity due to recruiting sources, difference in the pay as well as about the overall diversity in the organization race, gender and age. We conclude by considering a bigger, richer dataset as well as data from multiple workplaces to extend our understanding of diversity before implying anything concrete from the current analysis.
